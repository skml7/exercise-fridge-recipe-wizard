# Changelog updates are mandatory

Whenever you make **any user-requested change** (code, configs, docs, UI, dependencies), you must also update `CHANGELOG.md` in **Keep a Changelog** format.

## Rules

- **Always update** `CHANGELOG.md` in the same work session as the change.
- Write entries under **`## [Unreleased]`** unless explicitly instructed to cut a release.
- Use the standard section headings when applicable:
  - `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Deprecated`, `### Removed`, `### Fixed`, `### Security`
- Keep bullets **actionable** and written from the user’s point of view.
- Do **not** include secrets, API keys, or internal tokens in the changelog.

## Example

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added TheMealDB as a free recipe source.

### Fixed
- Fixed LangGraph missing START edge that prevented graph compilation.
```
